## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer with experience in Python and Django programming. I am also familiar with other web technologies, such as ReactJS.

In my work, I focus on designing, implementing, and testing software. I enjoy challenges, and creating innovative solutions and projects is not only my job but also my passion.

I value flexibility in my work. Additionally, I provide programming services outside of my work, which allows me to develop my skills and expand my knowledge.

In my opinion, good collaboration is based on mutual trust, understanding, and communication. I always strive to do my tasks as well as possible and effectively cooperate with others.

I am convinced that my programming skills and experience can make a valuable contribution to the development of my future clients' projects.
